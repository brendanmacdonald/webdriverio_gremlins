### Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Execute tests
```
npm run test
```

The tests will run in a Chrome browser. 
The Chrom Dev Tools will be open by default.
Clicking on the Console tab will show yu the actions being performed by the gremlins.

### Future work
Currently, there is no report generated of the results.
This means a user has to watch the tests running to confirm if there is an error or not.

### Highlights
 - chrome options '--auto-open-devtools-for-tabs' to force chrome dev tools to open
 - monkey testing chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/monkey-testing/igjkbipmddlfgjmalgkfibifnknbcpak?hl=en)
